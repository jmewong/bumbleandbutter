<h5 class="section_title">MEET JAMIE AND KATIE.</h5>

<p class="description">Jamie and Katie met in 2015 in their freshman year at the School of Hotel Administration at Cornell University, bonding over their love for eating delicious, wholesome food. Making granola has been ingrained in Jamie since high school, when she would make the crunchy goodness for all her friends. So when Katie got a taste of it, they decided to pack it up and make their shared dreams of starting a food business come true!</p>

<h5 class="section_title">OUR PHILOSOPHY.</h5>

<p class="description">We love eating good food and feeling good about what we eat. Eating well is not only important for our health, but also for our happiness and environmental impact on the planet. We don&rsquo;t shy away from eating a little butter or sugar &ndash; these ingredients are kept in their whole and natural form, providing taste, nutrients, and satiety! With that in mind, we bake our granola with ingredients that are responsibly sourced and that truly create depth in our flavors.</p>

<p class="name">Katie Lee<br />
Managing Partner/President of Business Development</p>

<p class="description">Katie discovered her passion for wholesome, sustainable food at Choate Rosemary Hall through participating in an environmental program and has come to appreciate every story behind the food that sits on her plate. Her enthusiasm for food continues to flourish at Cornell with her classes ranging from topics in food science to nutrition. Katie can never be too far from food and strategically lives on top of a grocery store so she can shop for ingredients anytime and invite friends over to cook. She keeps herself busy with the many organizations she&#39;s involved in on campus and loves learning from her experiences and from those around her. When she&#39;s not eating, Katie enjoys dancing to her favorite tunes, finding the perfect angle to capture beautiful moments, and being amazed by the pleasant surprises she finds in life.</p>

<p class="name">Jamie Kim<br />
Founder / CEO / Product &amp; Brand Development</p>

<p class="description">Jamie grew up in the suburbs of New Jersey next to New York City, doing all sorts of things from carving oboe reeds to playing tennis. Despite her various interests, she always set aside time to plan multiple course meals (with printed menus of course) for her family and friends. As her love for hosting gatherings grew, she found herself during her high school summers working at what is currently named one of the best restaurants in the world, Eleven Madison Park in New York City. There, she truly learned and reinforced her love for providing an experience and going above and beyond for others. Now what is Jamie doing? Well, she&#39;s still in school, planning to graduate in 2019. In her free time, Jamie can be found eating a surprising amount of food, painting watercolors, and flaunting her Birkenstocks. She is always excited to meet new people and learn a new skill, if you have one for her.<br />
